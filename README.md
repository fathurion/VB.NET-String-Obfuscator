VB.NET String Obfuscator

Convert your secret string into an obfuscated code, using multiple encoding and encryption with different key every char. its a bad obfuscation and need more improvement.
this obfuscation can be cracked easily by call the string using dnSpy (now i'm just realizing why im doing this, lol), using external protectors is highly recommended.
